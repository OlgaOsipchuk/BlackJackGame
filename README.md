## Rules of the game:

In this game player and dealer compete against the house.  
At the beginning of the game dealer is dealing cards. Player is getting 2 cards face up and dealer has one face up and another face down. 
The idea of this game is to get a hand total of closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21 (busting). If your cards ever equal a total of 21, you automatically get Blackjack (win) unless both player and the dealer get 21 then player push (tie).

If the player or the dealer's points total more than 21, then whoever reached that amount is automatically busted and loses the game. The dealer must also have at least 17 points by the end of the game. If the dealer's first two cards do not total at least 17, then the dealer must keep drawing more cards until reaching a minimum of 17 points.

How to count points:

..* **2 to 10** - face values
**J, Q, K** - valued at 10
**A** - valued 11 unless that would result in the hand going over 21, in which case it is valued as 1.
